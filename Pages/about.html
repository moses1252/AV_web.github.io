            My story of how I made it this far it's not a short one.
          </p>
          <p><strong>SO LETS MAKE IT SHORT</strong></p>
          <p class="sum">
            I am an undergraduate attending California State University of Los Angeles. I am earning my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer science.
            I am currently a Fourth year, and I expect to graduate in the year 2022. The reason I chose Computer Science is it fit me best compared to
            all the other stem majors, and being efficient is one of my best qualities, so Computer Science felt natural to me. Currently I am enrolled
            in Principles of Database Systems, Introduction to Automata Theory, Computer Organization, and Operating Systems. What separates me from my
            peers is my personal projects, I know that attending classes isn’t enough, so I took initiative to join Association for Computer Machinery(ACM),
            which has drastically improved my use of learning multiple languages, collaborating with multiple teams, and being a leader by holding
            a web officer position, where I code and develop for the organization’s website. My goals are to find a summer internship as a software engineer
            in web development where I can utilize my skills and work in a professional environment. What I want to gain is experience that is not offered at
             Cal State La. I would love to know if you have any opportunities, I can take advantage of.
